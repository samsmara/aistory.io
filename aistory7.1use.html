<p> &nbsp; Dying James charles</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Short Story by angl</p>
<p>&nbsp; James charles looked at the fluffy box in his hands and felt tense. He walked over to the window and reflected on his fever dream surroundings. He had always loved sugar high playa vista boxing ring with its soft, square sharp acrylic nails. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel tense. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Nor Vina. Nor was a bruised Kim kardashian with musklike nose job and phospholipidical stick on eyelash. James gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a dying, choking, fluids drinker with wiggly nose job and prokaryotic stick on eyelash. His friends saw him as a cool, clever child predator. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a forgotten jefree starr. But not even a dying person who had once made a cup of tea for a forgotten jefree starr, was prepared for what Nor had in store today. The storm teased like gunning kittens, making James powdery. As James stepped outside and Nor came closer, he could see the unknown smile on her face. "I am here because I want palette," Nor bellowed, in a wounded tone. She slammed her fist against James's chest, with the force of 5375 cockroaches. "I frigging love you, James charles." James looked back, even more powdery and still fingering the fluffy box. "Nor, Im a celebrity, I can do anything!!!!," he replied. They looked at each other with plastic feelings, like two deep, damaged drogs dying at a very crying nikocado avocado's funeral, which had elevator music playing in the background and two roaring uncles scratching to the beat. James regarded Nor's musklike nose job and phospholipidical stick on eyelash. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently. "Hmph," pondered Nor. "Please?" begged James with puppy dog eyes. Nor looked carnivorous, her body blushing like a big, black beating stick. Then Nor came inside for a nice drink of fluids. THE END</p>
